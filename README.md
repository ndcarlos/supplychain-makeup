# Supply Chain Analysis for a Makeup Startup

This repository contains my project on inventory optimization and demand forecasting for a Fashion & Beauty startup. Using data from [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshsingh2209/supply-chain-analysis), I explored strategies to minimize excess stock, reduce costs, and improve demand planning.
