# 📦 Supply Chain Optimization for a Makeup Startup

This repository contains Python scripts and analyses focused on optimizing inventory levels, forecasting demand, and improving replenishment planning — using data modeled after operations at a Fashion & Beauty startup.

Built on top of [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshsingh2209/supply-chain-analysis) , the project simulates a year’s worth of operations through synthetic data generation and data-driven inventory strategies.

## 🙋 Overview
This repository aims to showcase real-world supply chain analytics workflows, including:

* 📦 **Inventory Optimization**: Analyzing stock imbalances, calculating ideal stock levels, and optimizing reorder points to minimize carrying costs.
* 🔮 **Demand Forecasting**: Generating synthetic data to model annual demand trends and predict future stock needs more accurately.
* 🔁 **Replenishment Planning**: Creating SKU-level reorder plans that account for lead times, demand variability, and service level targets.
* 🔍 **Key goal**: Demonstrate how data-driven inventory strategies can help businesses reduce stockouts, avoid overstocking, and improve fulfillment efficiency.
